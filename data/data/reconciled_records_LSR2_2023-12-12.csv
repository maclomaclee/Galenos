The results were then compared with our past findings in male animals. Female adult Wistar rats subjected to PTSD were treated with moderate treadmill exercise or fluoxetine, or a combination of both. PTSD was induced by the single prolonged stress (SPS) model. Elevated plus-maze (EPM), serum and prefrontal BDNF, and fear extinctions were evaluated. The results showed that exercise plus fluoxetine decreased anxiety-like behavior, improved fear extinction, and increased BDNF changes in female rats. The effects of exercise alone were comparable with those of combination therapy except that combination therapy was more effective on OAT (open arm entry). The majority of results in female rats, except for those of prefrontal BDNF, 4th extinction, and OAT, were similar to those of male rats as shown in our previous study. According to our findings, exercise as a safe and cost-effective intervention can be considered as a complementary efficient option for PTSD treatment in both sexes.

Following the exercise, rats were exposed to SPS (restraint for 2 h, forced swimming for 20 min and ether anesthesia), and then they were kept undisturbed for 14 days. After testing anxiety-like behaviours in the elevated plus maze, the levels of corticosterone and BDNF in serum and BDNF and apoptosis markers (Bax, Bcl-2, and Caspase) in hippocampus were measured. Sedentary male and female SPS rats significantly (Ps ranging < 0.05 to < 0.0001) exhibited increased anxiety levels in the elevated plus maze, enhanced serum corticosterone, reduced serum and hippocampal BDNF and enhanced hippocampal apoptosis than the corresponding control group. Prior exercise significantly (Ps ranging < 0.05 to < 0.001) alleviated all SPS-induced behavioral and biochemical alterations as compared with the sedentary SPS rats. There were no significant differences in serum and hippocampal BDNF and serum corticosterone levels and hippocampal apoptotic markers between male and female rats in all of groups. Our findings strongly support that short term prior exercise training can prevent the harmful effects of traumatic events, and the resulting trauma-related disorders in both sexes.

Following the exercise, rats were exposed to SPS (restraint for 2 h, forced swimming for 20 min and ether anesthesia), and then they were kept undisturbed for 14 days. After testing anxiety-like behaviours in the elevated plus maze, the levels of corticosterone and BDNF in serum and BDNF and apoptosis markers (Bax, Bcl-2, and Caspase) in hippocampus were measured. Sedentary male and female SPS rats significantly (Ps ranging < 0.05 to < 0.0001) exhibited increased anxiety levels in the elevated plus maze, enhanced serum corticosterone, reduced serum and hippocampal BDNF and enhanced hippocampal apoptosis than the corresponding control group. Prior exercise significantly (Ps ranging < 0.05 to < 0.001) alleviated all SPS-induced behavioral and biochemical alterations as compared with the sedentary SPS rats. There were no significant differences in serum and hippocampal BDNF and serum corticosterone levels and hippocampal apoptotic markers between male and female rats in all of groups. Our findings strongly support that short term prior exercise training can prevent the harmful effects of traumatic events, and the resulting trauma-related disorders in both sexes.

The present study investigated the effects of prior moderate treadmill exercise on anxiety-like behaviors, serum corticosterone and BDNF levels, hippocampal BDNF and mRNA expression of apoptotic - related proteins in the single prolonged stress (SPS) as an animal model of PTSD in rats. Male and female rats underwent a regular treadmill exercise regimen (4 weeks, 5 days per week). Following the exercise, rats were exposed to SPS (restraint for 2 h, forced swimming for 20 min and ether anesthesia), and then they were kept undisturbed for 14 days. After testing anxiety-like behaviours in the elevated plus maze, the levels of corticosterone and BDNF in serum and BDNF and apoptosis markers (Bax, Bcl-2, and Caspase) in hippocampus were measured. Sedentary male and female SPS rats significantly (Ps ranging < 0.05 to < 0.0001) exhibited increased anxiety levels in the elevated plus maze, enhanced serum corticosterone, reduced serum and hippocampal BDNF and enhanced hippocampal apoptosis than the corresponding control group. Prior exercise significantly (Ps ranging < 0.05 to < 0.001) alleviated all SPS-induced behavioral and biochemical alterations as compared with the sedentary SPS rats. There were no significant differences in serum and hippocampal BDNF and serum corticosterone levels and hippocampal apoptotic markers between male and female rats in all of groups. Our findings strongly support that short term prior exercise training can prevent the harmful effects of traumatic events, and the resulting trauma-related disorders in both sexes.

Following the exercise, rats were exposed to SPS (restraint for 2 h, forced swimming for 20 min and ether anesthesia), and then they were kept undisturbed for 14 days. After testing anxiety-like behaviours in the elevated plus maze, the levels of corticosterone and BDNF in serum and BDNF and apoptosis markers (Bax, Bcl-2, and Caspase) in hippocampus were measured. Sedentary male and female SPS rats significantly (Ps ranging < 0.05 to < 0.0001) exhibited increased anxiety levels in the elevated plus maze, enhanced serum corticosterone, reduced serum and hippocampal BDNF and enhanced hippocampal apoptosis than the corresponding control group. Prior exercise significantly (Ps ranging < 0.05 to < 0.001) alleviated all SPS-induced behavioral and biochemical alterations as compared with the sedentary SPS rats. There were no significant differences in serum and hippocampal BDNF and serum corticosterone levels and hippocampal apoptotic markers between male and female rats in all of groups. Our findings strongly support that short term prior exercise training can prevent the harmful effects of traumatic events, and the resulting trauma-related disorders in both sexes.

On day 65, after assessing rats using the elevated plus-maze (EPM) test, corticosterone, BDNF, and apoptotic markers were tested. p < 0.05 was considered as significant level. The results showed that ovariectomy worsened the effect of SPS on hippocampal BDNF and led to greater increase in serum corticosterone and hippocampal caspase 3 and BAX in SPS rats. Also, ovariectomy exacerbated anxiety-like behavior in SPS rats. Exercise improved the alterations of hippocampal BDNF, corticosterone, caspase 3, and BAX in SPS ovariectomized rats. However, exercise had no statistically significant effect on anxiety-like behavior in this group. According to the results, exercise is effective to attenuate SPS-induced impairments in molecular and cellular responses even when the condition becomes more complicated due to ovarian hormone deficiency. However, exercise alone cannot help to improve behavior impairments in PTSD combined with an ovarian hormone deficiency. Therefore, exercise could likely be considered as a complementary intervention to strengthen other treatments.

According to the results, exercise is effective to attenuate SPS-induced impairments in molecular and cellular responses even when the condition becomes more complicated due to ovarian hormone deficiency.

According to the results, exercise is effective to attenuate SPS-induced impairments in molecular and cellular responses even when the condition becomes more complicated due to ovarian hormone deficiency. However, exercise alone cannot help to improve behavior impairments in PTSD combined with an ovarian hormone deficiency. Therefore, exercise could likely be considered as a complementary intervention to strengthen other treatments.

The results showed that ovariectomy worsened the effect of SPS on hippocampal BDNF and led to greater increase in serum corticosterone and hippocampal caspase 3 and BAX in SPS rats. Also, ovariectomy exacerbated anxiety-like behavior in SPS rats. Exercise improved the alterations of hippocampal BDNF, corticosterone, caspase 3, and BAX in SPS ovariectomized rats. However, exercise had no statistically significant effect on anxiety-like behavior in this group. According to the results, exercise is effective to attenuate SPS-induced impairments in molecular and cellular responses even when the condition becomes more complicated due to ovarian hormone deficiency. However, exercise alone cannot help to improve behavior impairments in PTSD combined with an ovarian hormone deficiency. Therefore, exercise could likely be considered as a complementary intervention to strengthen other treatments.

The results showed that ovariectomy worsened the effect of SPS on hippocampal BDNF and led to greater increase in serum corticosterone and hippocampal caspase 3 and BAX in SPS rats. Also, ovariectomy exacerbated anxiety-like behavior in SPS rats. Exercise improved the alterations of hippocampal BDNF, corticosterone, caspase 3, and BAX in SPS ovariectomized rats. However, exercise had no statistically significant effect on anxiety-like behavior in this group. According to the results, exercise is effective to attenuate SPS-induced impairments in molecular and cellular responses even when the condition becomes more complicated due to ovarian hormone deficiency. However, exercise alone cannot help to improve behavior impairments in PTSD combined with an ovarian hormone deficiency. Therefore, exercise could likely be considered as a complementary intervention to strengthen other treatments.

According to the results, exercise is effective to attenuate SPS-induced impairments in molecular and cellular responses even when the condition becomes more complicated due to ovarian hormone deficiency.

However, exercise had no statistically significant effect on anxiety-like behavior in this group. According to the results, exercise is effective to attenuate SPS-induced impairments in molecular and cellular responses even when the condition becomes more complicated due to ovarian hormone deficiency. However, exercise alone cannot help to improve behavior impairments in PTSD combined with an ovarian hormone deficiency. Therefore, exercise could likely be considered as a complementary intervention to strengthen other treatments.

On day 65, after assessing rats using the elevated plus-maze (EPM) test, corticosterone, BDNF, and apoptotic markers were tested. p < 0.05 was considered as significant level. The results showed that ovariectomy worsened the effect of SPS on hippocampal BDNF and led to greater increase in serum corticosterone and hippocampal caspase 3 and BAX in SPS rats. Also, ovariectomy exacerbated anxiety-like behavior in SPS rats. Exercise improved the alterations of hippocampal BDNF, corticosterone, caspase 3, and BAX in SPS ovariectomized rats. However, exercise had no statistically significant effect on anxiety-like behavior in this group. According to the results, exercise is effective to attenuate SPS-induced impairments in molecular and cellular responses even when the condition becomes more complicated due to ovarian hormone deficiency. However, exercise alone cannot help to improve behavior impairments in PTSD combined with an ovarian hormone deficiency. Therefore, exercise could likely be considered as a complementary intervention to strengthen other treatments.

The exercise started 14 days after SPS and continued for 4 weeks. Thirty minutes moderate treadmill exercise was planned for 5 days per week. On day 65, after assessing rats using the elevated plus-maze (EPM) test, corticosterone, BDNF, and apoptotic markers were tested. p < 0.05 was considered as significant level. The results showed that ovariectomy worsened the effect of SPS on hippocampal BDNF and led to greater increase in serum corticosterone and hippocampal caspase 3 and BAX in SPS rats. Also, ovariectomy exacerbated anxiety-like behavior in SPS rats. Exercise improved the alterations of hippocampal BDNF, corticosterone, caspase 3, and BAX in SPS ovariectomized rats. However, exercise had no statistically significant effect on anxiety-like behavior in this group. According to the results, exercise is effective to attenuate SPS-induced impairments in molecular and cellular responses even when the condition becomes more complicated due to ovarian hormone deficiency. However, exercise alone cannot help to improve behavior impairments in PTSD combined with an ovarian hormone deficiency. Therefore, exercise could likely be considered as a complementary intervention to strengthen other treatments.

On the fifth week, PTSD was induced by single prolonged stress protocol. Cognitive functions were evaluated by object recognition, anxiety levels by hole-board and elevated plus maze, and fear conditioning by passive avoidance tests. Following decapitation, malondialdehyde (MDA), glutathione (GSH), luminol and lucigenin chemiluminescence levels, and myeloperoxidase (MPO), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) activities were measured, and histopathological damage was evaluated. The data was analyzed by one-way ANOVA. Cognitive decline and aggravated anxiety levels in SED + PTSD group were improved in both PTSD-induced exercise groups (p < 0.05-0.001). The increased chemiluminescence levels, MPO activity and histological damage were depressed in both PTSD-induced exercise groups (p < 0.05-0.001). The risen MDA levels in SED + PTSD group were suppressed only in HIIT + PTSD group (p < 0.01-0.001). The decreased GSH levels were increased by MICT (p < 0.05-0.001), and CAT and SOD activities were improved via HIIT (p < 0.05). Compared to SED group, latency was decreased in SED + PTSD (p < 0.05-0.01) group. Neuronal damage scores were alleviated in both PTSD-induced exercise groups (p < 0.001). PTSD-induced memory decline was protected by both of the exercise models however more effectively by HIIT via decreasing oxidative stress, anxiety levels and by improving antioxidant capacity as a protective system for neuronal damage.

SPS rats exhibited increased anxiety levels in the elevated plus maze and light/dark box, impaired fear conditioning and extinction in inhibitory avoidance (IA) task, impaired spatial memory in a recognition location memory task and enhanced negative feedback on the HPA axis following a dexamethasone suppression test.

Rats were exposed to SPS (restraint for 2h, forced swimming for 20min and ether anaesthesia) and were then kept undisturbed for 14days. After that, SPS rats were subjected to chronic treatment with fluoxetine (10mg/kg/day, for 4weeks), moderate treadmill running (4weeks, 5day per week) and the combined treatment (fluoxetine plus treadmill exercise), followed by behavioural, biochemical and apoptosis markers assessments. SPS rats exhibited increased anxiety levels in the elevated plus maze and light/dark box, impaired fear conditioning and extinction in inhibitory avoidance (IA) task, impaired spatial memory in a recognition location memory task and enhanced negative feedback on the HPA axis following a dexamethasone suppression test. SPS rats also showed reduced hippocampal BDNF and enhanced apoptosis. Moderate treadmill exercise, fluoxetine and the combined treatment alleviated the SPS-induced alterations in terms of anxiety levels, HPA axis inhibition, IA conditioning and extinction, hippocampal BDNF and apoptosis markers. Furthermore, the combined treatment was more effective than fluoxetine alone, but in most tests, the effects of the combined treatment were similar to those of exercise alone, suggesting that exercise is the main factor in the beneficial effects of the combined therapy in PTSD patients.

This study was set to explore the therapeutic effects and the mechanisms of treadmill exercise on a time-dependent sensitization (TDS) model which is a classical animal model for mimicking posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). METHODS: Forty-seven rats were randomly assigned to one of four groups: CON (control), TDS (model), EX (treadmill), or SER (sertraline). TDS model was developed to evaluate the anti-PTSD-like effects of moderate treadmill exercise with 4-week running program. High-performance liquid chromatography technology was used to determine the levels of monoamine neurotransmitters in TDS rats. The expression of key proteins in BDNF/PI3K/Akt/CREB signaling pathway were assayed by the Western blot method. RESULTS: The TDS procedures induced behavioral deficiencies. These deficiencies were reversed by treadmill exercise. Subsequent monoamine assays revealed that the treadmill exercise significantly increased serotonin levels in the hippocampus and decreased dopamine levels in the prefrontal cortex. Data from Western blot experiment demonstrated that exercise could normalize the decreased BDNF/TrkB/pAkt/pCREB levels in the hippocampus. CONCLUSIONS: This study deduced that treadmill exercise ameliorated contextual fear conditioning and anxiety-like behavior in TDS model.

This study was set to explore the therapeutic effects and the mechanisms of treadmill exercise on a time-dependent sensitization (TDS) model which is a classical animal model for mimicking posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). METHODS: Forty-seven rats were randomly assigned to one of four groups: CON (control), TDS (model), EX (treadmill), or SER (sertraline). TDS model was developed to evaluate the anti-PTSD-like effects of moderate treadmill exercise with 4-week running program. High-performance liquid chromatography technology was used to determine the levels of monoamine neurotransmitters in TDS rats. The expression of key proteins in BDNF/PI3K/Akt/CREB signaling pathway were assayed by the Western blot method. RESULTS: The TDS procedures induced behavioral deficiencies. These deficiencies were reversed by treadmill exercise. Subsequent monoamine assays revealed that the treadmill exercise significantly increased serotonin levels in the hippocampus and decreased dopamine levels in the prefrontal cortex. Data from Western blot experiment demonstrated that exercise could normalize the decreased BDNF/TrkB/pAkt/pCREB levels in the hippocampus. CONCLUSIONS: This study deduced that treadmill exercise ameliorated contextual fear conditioning and anxiety-like behavior in TDS model. According to the study, the mechanism involved in alleviating PTSD symptoms by treadmill exercise was due to increased 5-HT levels in the hippocampus and decreased DA levels in the prefrontal cortex.

This study was set to explore the therapeutic effects and the mechanisms of treadmill exercise on a time-dependent sensitization (TDS) model which is a classical animal model for mimicking posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). METHODS: Forty-seven rats were randomly assigned to one of four groups: CON (control), TDS (model), EX (treadmill), or SER (sertraline). TDS model was developed to evaluate the anti-PTSD-like effects of moderate treadmill exercise with 4-week running program. High-performance liquid chromatography technology was used to determine the levels of monoamine neurotransmitters in TDS rats. The expression of key proteins in BDNF/PI3K/Akt/CREB signaling pathway were assayed by the Western blot method. RESULTS: The TDS procedures induced behavioral deficiencies. These deficiencies were reversed by treadmill exercise. Subsequent monoamine assays revealed that the treadmill exercise significantly increased serotonin levels in the hippocampus and decreased dopamine levels in the prefrontal cortex. Data from Western blot experiment demonstrated that exercise could normalize the decreased BDNF/TrkB/pAkt/pCREB levels in the hippocampus.

This study was set to explore the therapeutic effects and the mechanisms of treadmill exercise on a time-dependent sensitization (TDS) model which is a classical animal model for mimicking posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). METHODS: Forty-seven rats were randomly assigned to one of four groups: CON (control), TDS (model), EX (treadmill), or SER (sertraline). TDS model was developed to evaluate the anti-PTSD-like effects of moderate treadmill exercise with 4-week running program. High-performance liquid chromatography technology was used to determine the levels of monoamine neurotransmitters in TDS rats. The expression of key proteins in BDNF/PI3K/Akt/CREB signaling pathway were assayed by the Western blot method. RESULTS: The TDS procedures induced behavioral deficiencies. These deficiencies were reversed by treadmill exercise. Subsequent monoamine assays revealed that the treadmill exercise significantly increased serotonin levels in the hippocampus and decreased dopamine levels in the prefrontal cortex. Data from Western blot experiment demonstrated that exercise could normalize the decreased BDNF/TrkB/pAkt/pCREB levels in the hippocampus. CONCLUSIONS: This study deduced that treadmill exercise ameliorated contextual fear conditioning and anxiety-like behavior in TDS model. According to the study, the mechanism involved in alleviating PTSD symptoms by treadmill exercise was due to increased 5-HT levels in the hippocampus and decreased DA levels in the prefrontal cortex.

This study was set to explore the therapeutic effects and the mechanisms of treadmill exercise on a time-dependent sensitization (TDS) model which is a classical animal model for mimicking posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). METHODS: Forty-seven rats were randomly assigned to one of four groups: CON (control), TDS (model), EX (treadmill), or SER (sertraline). TDS model was developed to evaluate the anti-PTSD-like effects of moderate treadmill exercise with 4-week running program. High-performance liquid chromatography technology was used to determine the levels of monoamine neurotransmitters in TDS rats. The expression of key proteins in BDNF/PI3K/Akt/CREB signaling pathway were assayed by the Western blot method. RESULTS: The TDS procedures induced behavioral deficiencies. These deficiencies were reversed by treadmill exercise. Subsequent monoamine assays revealed that the treadmill exercise significantly increased serotonin levels in the hippocampus and decreased dopamine levels in the prefrontal cortex.

In this disorder, the function of some hormonal and neurotransmitter systems are disturbed. Physical activity, by inducing beneficial effects on the brain structure, improves anxiety behaviors, increases the level of BDNF, and reduces the harmful effects of some neurological diseases. There are different perspectives on the most effective type of exercise that can have positive effects on physical and mental health. This study was carried out to investigate the effect of high and moderate exercise on healthy male and female rats and rats with PTSD. Materials and methods: Single prolonged stress (SPS) was used to induce PTSD in Wistar rats weighing (200-250 g). Moderate and high intensity exercise was performed and after four weeks, anxiety test was performed by EPM and serum levels of corticosterone, and hippocampal and serum BDNF were measured using Eliza. Results: The present study showed that SPS leads to increase in anxiety and serum corticosterone and decrease in hippocampal BDNF in male and female rats. Moderate-intensity exercise could improve these factors in male and female sham and PTSD rats, but high intensity exercise has no significant effects (P=0.991, P=0.999, P=0.996, respectively). Our findings showed no significant gender-related differences in these factors (P=1.000, P=0.998, P=0.984, respectively).

Our findings showed no significant gender-related differences in these factors (P=1.000, P=0.998, P=0.984, respectively). Conclusion: Moderate intensity exercise can be a suitable type of physical activity to reduce anxiety and increase hippocampal BDNF. <c2><a9> 2023, Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences.

In this disorder, the function of some hormonal and neurotransmitter systems are disturbed. Physical activity, by inducing beneficial effects on the brain structure, improves anxiety behaviors, increases the level of BDNF, and reduces the harmful effects of some neurological diseases. There are different perspectives on the most effective type of exercise that can have positive effects on physical and mental health. This study was carried out to investigate the effect of high and moderate exercise on healthy male and female rats and rats with PTSD. Materials and methods: Single prolonged stress (SPS) was used to induce PTSD in Wistar rats weighing (200-250 g). Moderate and high intensity exercise was performed and after four weeks, anxiety test was performed by EPM and serum levels of corticosterone, and hippocampal and serum BDNF were measured using Eliza. Results: The present study showed that SPS leads to increase in anxiety and serum corticosterone and decrease in hippocampal BDNF in male and female rats. Moderate-intensity exercise could improve these factors in male and female sham and PTSD rats, but high intensity exercise has no significant effects (P=0.991, P=0.999, P=0.996, respectively).

In this disorder, the function of some hormonal and neurotransmitter systems are disturbed. Physical activity, by inducing beneficial effects on the brain structure, improves anxiety behaviors, increases the level of BDNF, and reduces the harmful effects of some neurological diseases. There are different perspectives on the most effective type of exercise that can have positive effects on physical and mental health. This study was carried out to investigate the effect of high and moderate exercise on healthy male and female rats and rats with PTSD. Materials and methods: Single prolonged stress (SPS) was used to induce PTSD in Wistar rats weighing (200-250 g). Moderate and high intensity exercise was performed and after four weeks, anxiety test was performed by EPM and serum levels of corticosterone, and hippocampal and serum BDNF were measured using Eliza. Results: The present study showed that SPS leads to increase in anxiety and serum corticosterone and decrease in hippocampal BDNF in male and female rats.

In this disorder, the function of some hormonal and neurotransmitter systems are disturbed. Physical activity, by inducing beneficial effects on the brain structure, improves anxiety behaviors, increases the level of BDNF, and reduces the harmful effects of some neurological diseases. There are different perspectives on the most effective type of exercise that can have positive effects on physical and mental health. This study was carried out to investigate the effect of high and moderate exercise on healthy male and female rats and rats with PTSD. Materials and methods: Single prolonged stress (SPS) was used to induce PTSD in Wistar rats weighing (200-250 g). Moderate and high intensity exercise was performed and after four weeks, anxiety test was performed by EPM and serum levels of corticosterone, and hippocampal and serum BDNF were measured using Eliza. Results: The present study showed that SPS leads to increase in anxiety and serum corticosterone and decrease in hippocampal BDNF in male and female rats. Moderate-intensity exercise could improve these factors in male and female sham and PTSD rats, but high intensity exercise has no significant effects (P=0.991, P=0.999, P=0.996, respectively).

In this disorder, the function of some hormonal and neurotransmitter systems are disturbed. Physical activity, by inducing beneficial effects on the brain structure, improves anxiety behaviors, increases the level of BDNF, and reduces the harmful effects of some neurological diseases. There are different perspectives on the most effective type of exercise that can have positive effects on physical and mental health. This study was carried out to investigate the effect of high and moderate exercise on healthy male and female rats and rats with PTSD. Materials and methods: Single prolonged stress (SPS) was used to induce PTSD in Wistar rats weighing (200-250 g). Moderate and high intensity exercise was performed and after four weeks, anxiety test was performed by EPM and serum levels of corticosterone, and hippocampal and serum BDNF were measured using Eliza. Results: The present study showed that SPS leads to increase in anxiety and serum corticosterone and decrease in hippocampal BDNF in male and female rats. Moderate-intensity exercise could improve these factors in male and female sham and PTSD rats, but high intensity exercise has no significant effects (P=0.991, P=0.999, P=0.996, respectively).

In this disorder, the function of some hormonal and neurotransmitter systems are disturbed. Physical activity, by inducing beneficial effects on the brain structure, improves anxiety behaviors, increases the level of BDNF, and reduces the harmful effects of some neurological diseases. There are different perspectives on the most effective type of exercise that can have positive effects on physical and mental health. This study was carried out to investigate the effect of high and moderate exercise on healthy male and female rats and rats with PTSD.

Moderate and high intensity exercise was performed and after four weeks, anxiety test was performed by EPM and serum levels of corticosterone, and hippocampal and serum BDNF were measured using Eliza. Results: The present study showed that SPS leads to increase in anxiety and serum corticosterone and decrease in hippocampal BDNF in male and female rats.

In this disorder, the function of some hormonal and neurotransmitter systems are disturbed. Physical activity, by inducing beneficial effects on the brain structure, improves anxiety behaviors, increases the level of BDNF, and reduces the harmful effects of some neurological diseases. There are different perspectives on the most effective type of exercise that can have positive effects on physical and mental health. This study was carried out to investigate the effect of high and moderate exercise on healthy male and female rats and rats with PTSD. Materials and methods: Single prolonged stress (SPS) was used to induce PTSD in Wistar rats weighing (200-250 g). Moderate and high intensity exercise was performed and after four weeks, anxiety test was performed by EPM and serum levels of corticosterone, and hippocampal and serum BDNF were measured using Eliza. Results: The present study showed that SPS leads to increase in anxiety and serum corticosterone and decrease in hippocampal BDNF in male and female rats. Moderate-intensity exercise could improve these factors in male and female sham and PTSD rats, but high intensity exercise has no significant effects (P=0.991, P=0.999, P=0.996, respectively).

The aim of this study was to determine the effects of exercise and FLX on testicular tissue and sex hormones in rats with PTSD. Materials and methods: In this experimental study, 80 adult male rats were divided into two groups: PTSD and healthy. Then, each group was divided into four subgroups: control, exercise, fluoxetine, and fluoxetine + exercise. PTSD was induced by single prolonged stress. Fourteen days after induction of PTSD, moderate forced treadmill exercise was performed for 4 weeks, 5 days/week. Fluoxetine was administered at 10 mg/kg/day dissolved in drinking water for 4 weeks. Four weeks after treatment, the fear extinction test, testicular structure, and testosterone and FSH levels were evaluated. Results: PTSD decreased testosterone level and fear extinction but increased follicle-stimulating hormone. Fluoxetine and exercise had protective effect on testicular damage and also increased testosterone level and extinction index but decreased FSH level. Findings showed that co-administration of exercise and fluoxetine was more effective on these parameters.

Fluoxetine (FLX) as a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor is considered as the first line of treatment for PTSD. Exercise can improve the symptoms of PTSD. The aim of this study was to determine the effects of exercise and FLX on testicular tissue and sex hormones in rats with PTSD. Materials and methods: In this experimental study, 80 adult male rats were divided into two groups: PTSD and healthy. Then, each group was divided into four subgroups: control, exercise, fluoxetine, and fluoxetine + exercise. PTSD was induced by single prolonged stress. Fourteen days after induction of PTSD, moderate forced treadmill exercise was performed for 4 weeks, 5 days/week. Fluoxetine was administered at 10 mg/kg/day dissolved in drinking water for 4 weeks. Four weeks after treatment, the fear extinction test, testicular structure, and testosterone and FSH levels were evaluated. Results: PTSD decreased testosterone level and fear extinction but increased follicle-stimulating hormone. Fluoxetine and exercise had protective effect on testicular damage and also increased testosterone level and extinction index but decreased FSH level. Findings showed that co-administration of exercise and fluoxetine was more effective on these parameters. Combination of exercise and fluoxetine significantly increased fear extinction in PTSD rats (P<0.05). Conclusion: Exercise and fluoxetine had a protective effect on testicular tissue structure and hormonal disorders caused by PTSD and also decreased fear caused by stress, which is one of the symptoms of this disease. <c2><a9> 2022, Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences.

In this project, we studied the effect of exercise as an effective factor on improving anxiety and serum levels of corticosterone and IGF-1in male PTSD rats. Materials and methods: In this experimental study, single prolonged stress (SPS) was used to induce PTSD in male Wistar rats. The animals were divided into two groups: Sham (Non-SPS [NSPS]) and SPS. The two groups were then divided into two subgroups and one of the subgroups in each group did the exercise after two weeks which continued for four weeks according to the following program: moderate treadmill exercise, 5 days a week; the first two weeks 10m/min and the second two weeks 15m/min). Then, anxiety test was performed by open field test and serum levels of IGF-1 and corticosterone were measured using Eliza. Results: The rats in SPS group exhibited increased anxiety levels in open field test, decreased serum IGF-1 levels, and increased serum corticosterone levels compared with the controls.

In this project, we studied the effect of exercise as an effective factor on improving anxiety and serum levels of corticosterone and IGF-1in male PTSD rats. Materials and methods: In this experimental study, single prolonged stress (SPS) was used to induce PTSD in male Wistar rats. The animals were divided into two groups: Sham (Non-SPS [NSPS]) and SPS. The two groups were then divided into two subgroups and one of the subgroups in each group did the exercise after two weeks which continued for four weeks according to the following program: moderate treadmill exercise, 5 days a week; the first two weeks 10m/min and the second two weeks 15m/min). Then, anxiety test was performed by open field test and serum levels of IGF-1 and corticosterone were measured using Eliza.

Male SPS rats showed impaired spatial memory in object-location memory task. Treadmill exercise, fluoxetine, and combined treatment reduced anxiety levels, improved spatial memory, and decreased positive tunnel cells in the hippocampus. Furthermore, combined treatment with fluoxetine and treadmill exercise was found to be more effective than fluoxetine alone. Female rats had more resilience than male rats. Conclusion: Combined intervention with moderate exercise and fluoxetine is more useful in treatment of behavioral and cellular injuries in PTSD patients. <c2><a9> 2021, Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences.

Then, anxiety and memory test and tunnel assessments were done. Results: SPS rats exhibited increased anxiety levels in light/dark box and enhanced hippocampal apoptotic cells. Male SPS rats showed impaired spatial memory in object-location memory task. Treadmill exercise, fluoxetine, and combined treatment reduced anxiety levels, improved spatial memory, and decreased positive tunnel cells in the hippocampus. Furthermore, combined treatment with fluoxetine and treadmill exercise was found to be more effective than fluoxetine alone. Female rats had more resilience than male rats. Conclusion: Combined intervention with moderate exercise and fluoxetine is more useful in treatment of behavioral and cellular injuries in PTSD patients. <c2><a9> 2021, Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences.

This study aimed at investigating the effects of moderate treadmill exercise and fluoxetine on anxiety, spatial memory, and positive tunnel cells in the hippocampus in a rat model of PTSD. Materials and methods: We used single prolonged stress (SPS) model as an animal model for PTSD. Male and female rats were divided into two groups: Sham and SPS. After Two weeks, interventions, including treadmill exercise (4 weeks, 5 days per week), fluoxetine (10 mg/kg/day), and combined treatment were performed. Then, anxiety and memory test and tunnel assessments were done. Results: SPS rats exhibited increased anxiety levels in light/dark box and enhanced hippocampal apoptotic cells. Male SPS rats showed impaired spatial memory in object-location memory task. Treadmill exercise, fluoxetine, and combined treatment reduced anxiety levels, improved spatial memory, and decreased positive tunnel cells in the hippocampus. Furthermore, combined treatment with fluoxetine and treadmill exercise was found to be more effective than fluoxetine alone. Female rats had more resilience than male rats. Conclusion: Combined intervention with moderate exercise and fluoxetine is more useful in treatment of behavioral and cellular injuries in PTSD patients. <c2><a9> 2021, Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences.

Male SPS rats showed impaired spatial memory in object-location memory task. Treadmill exercise, fluoxetine, and combined treatment reduced anxiety levels, improved spatial memory, and decreased positive tunnel cells in the hippocampus. Furthermore, combined treatment with fluoxetine and treadmill exercise was found to be more effective than fluoxetine alone. Female rats had more resilience than male rats. Conclusion: Combined intervention with moderate exercise and fluoxetine is more useful in treatment of behavioral and cellular injuries in PTSD patients. <c2><a9> 2021, Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences.

After Two weeks, interventions, including treadmill exercise (4 weeks, 5 days per week), fluoxetine (10 mg/kg/day), and combined treatment were performed. Then, anxiety and memory test and tunnel assessments were done. Results: SPS rats exhibited increased anxiety levels in light/dark box and enhanced hippocampal apoptotic cells. Male SPS rats showed impaired spatial memory in object-location memory task. Treadmill exercise, fluoxetine, and combined treatment reduced anxiety levels, improved spatial memory, and decreased positive tunnel cells in the hippocampus. Furthermore, combined treatment with fluoxetine and treadmill exercise was found to be more effective than fluoxetine alone. Female rats had more resilience than male rats. Conclusion: Combined intervention with moderate exercise and fluoxetine is more useful in treatment of behavioral and cellular injuries in PTSD patients. <c2><a9> 2021, Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences.

Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are the first-line treatment for PTSD. This study aimed at investigating the effects of moderate treadmill exercise and fluoxetine on spatial memory and serum BDNF levels in rat model of PTSD. Materials and methods: In this experimental study, single prolonged stress (SPS) animal model of PTSD was used. Male and female rats were divided into SPS and control groups (n=10 per group). After that, they were subjected to moderate treadmill running (5 days per week/four weeks) and fluoxetine (10 mg/kg/day). Then, behavioral assessment and BDNF measurement were done. Results: SPS male rats showed reduced spatial memory and hippocampal BDNF. Female rats showed more resistance to SPS than male rats. This may be due to the effects of gonadal hormones. The intervention alleviated the SPS-induced alterations in hippocampal-dependent spatial memory and BDNF serum levels in both male and female rats (P<0.05). Conclusion: Combined exercise and fluoxetine administration are more effective in alleviating behavioral and molecular deficits in PTSD patients. <c2><a9> 2019, Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences.

After performing the anxiety test, the animals were killed under deep anesthesia and blood samples were collected to measure IGF-1 serum levels by ELISA method and prefrontal cortex was frozen to measure apoptotic factors by RT-PCR method. Results: SPS rats showed increased anxiety levels and decreased serum IGF-1 levels. Increased Bax and Caspase-3 mRNA expression, and decreased Bcl2 mRNA expression were found in the prefrontal cortex. Exercise, fluoxetine, and their combined intervention increased IGF-1, decreased the expression of pro-apoptotic factors, and increased the expression of anti-apoptotic factors.

However, the efficacy of drug and psychotherapy methods, even in combination is still low. Therefore, complementary treatments are being researched. The relative improvement of PTSD has been observed with the use of Serotonin Selective Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs).
