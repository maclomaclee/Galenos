Continuing our previous study in male rats, this study aimed at better understanding the effect of a combination therapy of exercise with fluoxetine on female PTSD rats. The results were then compared with our past findings in male animals. Female adult Wistar rats subjected to PTSD were treated with moderate treadmill exercise or fluoxetine, or a combination of both. PTSD was induced by the single prolonged stress (SPS) model. Elevated plus-maze (EPM), serum and prefrontal BDNF, and fear extinctions were evaluated. The results showed that exercise plus fluoxetine decreased anxiety-like behavior, improved fear extinction, and increased BDNF changes in female rats. The effects of exercise alone were comparable with those of combination therapy except that combination therapy was more effective on OAT (open arm entry). The majority of results in female rats, except for those of prefrontal BDNF, 4th extinction, and OAT, were similar to those of male rats as shown in our previous study. According to our findings, exercise as a safe and cost-effective intervention can be considered as a complementary efficient option for PTSD treatment in both sexes.

Following the exercise, rats were exposed to SPS (restraint for 2 h, forced swimming for 20 min and ether anesthesia), and then they were kept undisturbed for 14 days. After testing anxiety-like behaviours in the elevated plus maze, the levels of corticosterone and BDNF in serum and BDNF and apoptosis markers (Bax, Bcl-2, and Caspase) in hippocampus were measured. Sedentary male and female SPS rats significantly (Ps ranging < 0.05 to < 0.0001) exhibited increased anxiety levels in the elevated plus maze, enhanced serum corticosterone, reduced serum and hippocampal BDNF and enhanced hippocampal apoptosis than the corresponding control group. Prior exercise significantly (Ps ranging < 0.05 to < 0.001) alleviated all SPS-induced behavioral and biochemical alterations as compared with the sedentary SPS rats. There were no significant differences in serum and hippocampal BDNF and serum corticosterone levels and hippocampal apoptotic markers between male and female rats in all of groups. Our findings strongly support that short term prior exercise training can prevent the harmful effects of traumatic events, and the resulting trauma-related disorders in both sexes.

Physical activity is known to improve symptoms of certain neuropsychiatric disorders. However, the role of exercise on acquired PTSD-like phenotype was not examined. The present study investigated the effects of prior moderate treadmill exercise on anxiety-like behaviors, serum corticosterone and BDNF levels, hippocampal BDNF and mRNA expression of apoptotic - related proteins in the single prolonged stress (SPS) as an animal model of PTSD in rats. Male and female rats underwent a regular treadmill exercise regimen (4 weeks, 5 days per week). Following the exercise, rats were exposed to SPS (restraint for 2 h, forced swimming for 20 min and ether anesthesia), and then they were kept undisturbed for 14 days. After testing anxiety-like behaviours in the elevated plus maze, the levels of corticosterone and BDNF in serum and BDNF and apoptosis markers (Bax, Bcl-2, and Caspase) in hippocampus were measured. Sedentary male and female SPS rats significantly (Ps ranging < 0.05 to < 0.0001) exhibited increased anxiety levels in the elevated plus maze, enhanced serum corticosterone, reduced serum and hippocampal BDNF and enhanced hippocampal apoptosis than the corresponding control group. Prior exercise significantly (Ps ranging < 0.05 to < 0.001) alleviated all SPS-induced behavioral and biochemical alterations as compared with the sedentary SPS rats. There were no significant differences in serum and hippocampal BDNF and serum corticosterone levels and hippocampal apoptotic markers between male and female rats in all of groups.

Also, ovariectomy exacerbated anxiety-like behavior in SPS rats. Exercise improved the alterations of hippocampal BDNF, corticosterone, caspase 3, and BAX in SPS ovariectomized rats. However, exercise had no statistically significant effect on anxiety-like behavior in this group. According to the results, exercise is effective to attenuate SPS-induced impairments in molecular and cellular responses even when the condition becomes more complicated due to ovarian hormone deficiency. However, exercise alone cannot help to improve behavior impairments in PTSD combined with an ovarian hormone deficiency. Therefore, exercise could likely be considered as a complementary intervention to strengthen other treatments.

Female rats (n = 44) were separated as," Sedentary (SED), moderate intensity continuous training (MICT), HIIT groups. Then the groups were divided into subgroups according to PTSD induction (n = 6-8/group). Exercise groups performed HIIT or MICT for 6 weeks. On the fifth week, PTSD was induced by single prolonged stress protocol. Cognitive functions were evaluated by object recognition, anxiety levels by hole-board and elevated plus maze, and fear conditioning by passive avoidance tests. Following decapitation, malondialdehyde (MDA), glutathione (GSH), luminol and lucigenin chemiluminescence levels, and myeloperoxidase (MPO), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) activities were measured, and histopathological damage was evaluated. The data was analyzed by one-way ANOVA. Cognitive decline and aggravated anxiety levels in SED + PTSD group were improved in both PTSD-induced exercise groups (p < 0.05-0.001). The increased chemiluminescence levels, MPO activity and histological damage were depressed in both PTSD-induced exercise groups (p < 0.05-0.001). The risen MDA levels in SED + PTSD group were suppressed only in HIIT + PTSD group (p < 0.01-0.001). The decreased GSH levels were increased by MICT (p < 0.05-0.001), and CAT and SOD activities were improved via HIIT (p < 0.05). Compared to SED group, latency was decreased in SED + PTSD (p < 0.05-0.01) group. Neuronal damage scores were alleviated in both PTSD-induced exercise groups (p < 0.001).

Female rats (n = 44) were separated as," Sedentary (SED), moderate intensity continuous training (MICT), HIIT groups. Then the groups were divided into subgroups according to PTSD induction (n = 6-8/group). Exercise groups performed HIIT or MICT for 6 weeks. On the fifth week, PTSD was induced by single prolonged stress protocol. Cognitive functions were evaluated by object recognition, anxiety levels by hole-board and elevated plus maze, and fear conditioning by passive avoidance tests. Following decapitation, malondialdehyde (MDA), glutathione (GSH), luminol and lucigenin chemiluminescence levels, and myeloperoxidase (MPO), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) activities were measured, and histopathological damage was evaluated. The data was analyzed by one-way ANOVA. Cognitive decline and aggravated anxiety levels in SED + PTSD group were improved in both PTSD-induced exercise groups (p < 0.05-0.001). The increased chemiluminescence levels, MPO activity and histological damage were depressed in both PTSD-induced exercise groups (p < 0.05-0.001). The risen MDA levels in SED + PTSD group were suppressed only in HIIT + PTSD group (p < 0.01-0.001). The decreased GSH levels were increased by MICT (p < 0.05-0.001), and CAT and SOD activities were improved via HIIT (p < 0.05). Compared to SED group, latency was decreased in SED + PTSD (p < 0.05-0.01) group. Neuronal damage scores were alleviated in both PTSD-induced exercise groups (p < 0.001).

773683e6-640d-48a1-a62a-ede40b04bcce,Moderate treadmill exercise rescues anxiety and depression-like behavior as well as memory impairment in a rat model of posttraumatic stress disorder,"Patki, Gaurav and Li, Lumeng and Allam, Farida and Solanki, Naimesh and Dao, An T and Alkadhi, Karim and Salim, Samina",Physiology & Behavior,NA,"Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a condition which can develop from exposure to a severe traumatic event such as those occurring during wars or natural disasters. Benzodiazepines and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are considered the gold standard for PTSD treatment, but their side effects pose a serious problem. While regular physical exercise is regarded as a mood elevator and known to enhance cognitive function, its direct role in rescuing core symptoms of PTSD including anxiety and depression-like behaviors and cognitive impairment is unclear. In the present study using the single-prolonged stress (SPS) rat model of PTSD (2h restrain, 20min forced swimming, 15min rest, and 1-2min diethyl ether exposure), we examined the beneficial effect of moderate treadmill exercise on SPS-induced behavioral deficits including anxiety and depression-like behaviors and memory impairment. Male Wistar rats were randomly assigned into four groups: control (sedentary), exercised, SPS (no exercise), or SPS-exercised. Rats were exercised on a rodent treadmill for 14 consecutive days. Rats in all groups were tested for anxiety-like behaviors using open field (OF), light-dark and elevated-plus maze tests. All rats were tested for short-term and long-term memory in the radial arm water maze test.

This study was set to explore the therapeutic effects and the mechanisms of treadmill exercise on a time-dependent sensitization (TDS) model which is a classical animal model for mimicking posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). METHODS: Forty-seven rats were randomly assigned to one of four groups: CON (control), TDS (model), EX (treadmill), or SER (sertraline). TDS model was developed to evaluate the anti-PTSD-like effects of moderate treadmill exercise with 4-week running program. High-performance liquid chromatography technology was used to determine the levels of monoamine neurotransmitters in TDS rats. The expression of key proteins in BDNF/PI3K/Akt/CREB signaling pathway were assayed by the Western blot method. RESULTS: The TDS procedures induced behavioral deficiencies.

Subsequent monoamine assays revealed that the treadmill exercise significantly increased serotonin levels in the hippocampus and decreased dopamine levels in the prefrontal cortex.

CONCLUSIONS: This study deduced that treadmill exercise ameliorated contextual fear conditioning and anxiety-like behavior in TDS model.

This study was set to explore the therapeutic effects and the mechanisms of treadmill exercise on a time-dependent sensitization (TDS) model which is a classical animal model for mimicking posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). METHODS: Forty-seven rats were randomly assigned to one of four groups: CON (control), TDS (model), EX (treadmill), or SER (sertraline). TDS model was developed to evaluate the anti-PTSD-like effects of moderate treadmill exercise with 4-week running program. High-performance liquid chromatography technology was used to determine the levels of monoamine neurotransmitters in TDS rats. The expression of key proteins in BDNF/PI3K/Akt/CREB signaling pathway were assayed by the Western blot method. RESULTS: The TDS procedures induced behavioral deficiencies. These deficiencies were reversed by treadmill exercise. Subsequent monoamine assays revealed that the treadmill exercise significantly increased serotonin levels in the hippocampus and decreased dopamine levels in the prefrontal cortex.

METHODS: Forty-seven rats were randomly assigned to one of four groups: CON (control), TDS (model), EX (treadmill), or SER (sertraline). TDS model was developed to evaluate the anti-PTSD-like effects of moderate treadmill exercise with 4-week running program. High-performance liquid chromatography technology was used to determine the levels of monoamine neurotransmitters in TDS rats. The expression of key proteins in BDNF/PI3K/Akt/CREB signaling pathway were assayed by the Western blot method. RESULTS: The TDS procedures induced behavioral deficiencies. These deficiencies were reversed by treadmill exercise. Subsequent monoamine assays revealed that the treadmill exercise significantly increased serotonin levels in the hippocampus and decreased dopamine levels in the prefrontal cortex. Data from Western blot experiment demonstrated that exercise could normalize the decreased BDNF/TrkB/pAkt/pCREB levels in the hippocampus. CONCLUSIONS: This study deduced that treadmill exercise ameliorated contextual fear conditioning and anxiety-like behavior in TDS model. According to the study, the mechanism involved in alleviating PTSD symptoms by treadmill exercise was due to increased 5-HT levels in the hippocampus and decreased DA levels in the prefrontal cortex.

This study was set to explore the therapeutic effects and the mechanisms of treadmill exercise on a time-dependent sensitization (TDS) model which is a classical animal model for mimicking posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). METHODS: Forty-seven rats were randomly assigned to one of four groups: CON (control), TDS (model), EX (treadmill), or SER (sertraline). TDS model was developed to evaluate the anti-PTSD-like effects of moderate treadmill exercise with 4-week running program. High-performance liquid chromatography technology was used to determine the levels of monoamine neurotransmitters in TDS rats. The expression of key proteins in BDNF/PI3K/Akt/CREB signaling pathway were assayed by the Western blot method. RESULTS: The TDS procedures induced behavioral deficiencies. These deficiencies were reversed by treadmill exercise. Subsequent monoamine assays revealed that the treadmill exercise significantly increased serotonin levels in the hippocampus and decreased dopamine levels in the prefrontal cortex. Data from Western blot experiment demonstrated that exercise could normalize the decreased BDNF/TrkB/pAkt/pCREB levels in the hippocampus. CONCLUSIONS: This study deduced that treadmill exercise ameliorated contextual fear conditioning and anxiety-like behavior in TDS model. According to the study, the mechanism involved in alleviating PTSD symptoms by treadmill exercise was due to increased 5-HT levels in the hippocampus and decreased DA levels in the prefrontal cortex.

In this disorder, the function of some hormonal and neurotransmitter systems are disturbed. Physical activity, by inducing beneficial effects on the brain structure, improves anxiety behaviors, increases the level of BDNF, and reduces the harmful effects of some neurological diseases. There are different perspectives on the most effective type of exercise that can have positive effects on physical and mental health. This study was carried out to investigate the effect of high and moderate exercise on healthy male and female rats and rats with PTSD. Materials and methods: Single prolonged stress (SPS) was used to induce PTSD in Wistar rats weighing (200-250 g). Moderate and high intensity exercise was performed and after four weeks, anxiety test was performed by EPM and serum levels of corticosterone, and hippocampal and serum BDNF were measured using Eliza. Results: The present study showed that SPS leads to increase in anxiety and serum corticosterone and decrease in hippocampal BDNF in male and female rats. Moderate-intensity exercise could improve these factors in male and female sham and PTSD rats, but high intensity exercise has no significant effects (P=0.991, P=0.999, P=0.996, respectively). Our findings showed no significant gender-related differences in these factors (P=1.000, P=0.998, P=0.984, respectively).

In this disorder, the function of some hormonal and neurotransmitter systems are disturbed. Physical activity, by inducing beneficial effects on the brain structure, improves anxiety behaviors, increases the level of BDNF, and reduces the harmful effects of some neurological diseases. There are different perspectives on the most effective type of exercise that can have positive effects on physical and mental health. This study was carried out to investigate the effect of high and moderate exercise on healthy male and female rats and rats with PTSD. Materials and methods: Single prolonged stress (SPS) was used to induce PTSD in Wistar rats weighing (200-250 g). Moderate and high intensity exercise was performed and after four weeks, anxiety test was performed by EPM and serum levels of corticosterone, and hippocampal and serum BDNF were measured using Eliza. Results: The present study showed that SPS leads to increase in anxiety and serum corticosterone and decrease in hippocampal BDNF in male and female rats. Moderate-intensity exercise could improve these factors in male and female sham and PTSD rats, but high intensity exercise has no significant effects (P=0.991, P=0.999, P=0.996, respectively).

In this disorder, the function of some hormonal and neurotransmitter systems are disturbed. Physical activity, by inducing beneficial effects on the brain structure, improves anxiety behaviors, increases the level of BDNF, and reduces the harmful effects of some neurological diseases. There are different perspectives on the most effective type of exercise that can have positive effects on physical and mental health. This study was carried out to investigate the effect of high and moderate exercise on healthy male and female rats and rats with PTSD. Materials and methods: Single prolonged stress (SPS) was used to induce PTSD in Wistar rats weighing (200-250 g). Moderate and high intensity exercise was performed and after four weeks, anxiety test was performed by EPM and serum levels of corticosterone, and hippocampal and serum BDNF were measured using Eliza. Results: The present study showed that SPS leads to increase in anxiety and serum corticosterone and decrease in hippocampal BDNF in male and female rats. Moderate-intensity exercise could improve these factors in male and female sham and PTSD rats, but high intensity exercise has no significant effects (P=0.991, P=0.999, P=0.996, respectively).

In this disorder, the function of some hormonal and neurotransmitter systems are disturbed. Physical activity, by inducing beneficial effects on the brain structure, improves anxiety behaviors, increases the level of BDNF, and reduces the harmful effects of some neurological diseases. There are different perspectives on the most effective type of exercise that can have positive effects on physical and mental health. This study was carried out to investigate the effect of high and moderate exercise on healthy male and female rats and rats with PTSD.

Moderate and high intensity exercise was performed and after four weeks, anxiety test was performed by EPM and serum levels of corticosterone, and hippocampal and serum BDNF were measured using Eliza. Results: The present study showed that SPS leads to increase in anxiety and serum corticosterone and decrease in hippocampal BDNF in male and female rats.

Fluoxetine (FLX) as a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor is considered as the first line of treatment for PTSD. Exercise can improve the symptoms of PTSD. The aim of this study was to determine the effects of exercise and FLX on testicular tissue and sex hormones in rats with PTSD. Materials and methods: In this experimental study, 80 adult male rats were divided into two groups: PTSD and healthy. Then, each group was divided into four subgroups: control, exercise, fluoxetine, and fluoxetine + exercise. PTSD was induced by single prolonged stress. Fourteen days after induction of PTSD, moderate forced treadmill exercise was performed for 4 weeks, 5 days/week. Fluoxetine was administered at 10 mg/kg/day dissolved in drinking water for 4 weeks. Four weeks after treatment, the fear extinction test, testicular structure, and testosterone and FSH levels were evaluated. Results: PTSD decreased testosterone level and fear extinction but increased follicle-stimulating hormone. Fluoxetine and exercise had protective effect on testicular damage and also increased testosterone level and extinction index but decreased FSH level. Findings showed that co-administration of exercise and fluoxetine was more effective on these parameters. Combination of exercise and fluoxetine significantly increased fear extinction in PTSD rats (P<0.05). Conclusion: Exercise and fluoxetine had a protective effect on testicular tissue structure and hormonal disorders caused by PTSD and also decreased fear caused by stress, which is one of the symptoms of this disease. <c2><a9> 2022, Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences.

Physiological studies of the brain have shown that serum corticosterone and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) levels have important roles during brain damage and trauma to the nervous system. In this project, we studied the effect of exercise as an effective factor on improving anxiety and serum levels of corticosterone and IGF-1in male PTSD rats. Materials and methods: In this experimental study, single prolonged stress (SPS) was used to induce PTSD in male Wistar rats. The animals were divided into two groups: Sham (Non-SPS [NSPS]) and SPS. The two groups were then divided into two subgroups and one of the subgroups in each group did the exercise after two weeks which continued for four weeks according to the following program: moderate treadmill exercise, 5 days a week"," the first two weeks 10m/min and the second two weeks 15m/min). Then, anxiety test was performed by open field test and serum levels of IGF-1 and corticosterone were measured using Eliza. Results: The rats in SPS group exhibited increased anxiety levels in open field test, decreased serum IGF-1 levels, and increased serum corticosterone levels compared with the controls. Moderate treadmill exercise alleviated SPS-induced alterations, anxiety, and IGF-1 and corticosterone levels.
