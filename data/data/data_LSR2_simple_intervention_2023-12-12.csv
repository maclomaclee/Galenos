Continuing our previous study in male rats, this study aimed at better understanding the effect of a combination therapy of exercise with fluoxetine on female PTSD rats. The results were then compared with our past findings in male animals. Female adult Wistar rats subjected to PTSD were treated with moderate treadmill exercise or fluoxetine, or a combination of both. PTSD was induced by the single prolonged stress (SPS) model. Elevated plus-maze (EPM), serum and prefrontal BDNF, and fear extinctions were evaluated. The results showed that exercise plus fluoxetine decreased anxiety-like behavior, improved fear extinction, and increased BDNF changes in female rats. The effects of exercise alone were comparable with those of combination therapy except that combination therapy was more effective on OAT (open arm entry). The majority of results in female rats, except for those of prefrontal BDNF, 4th extinction, and OAT, were similar to those of male rats as shown in our previous study. According to our findings, exercise as a safe and cost-effective intervention can be considered as a complementary efficient option for PTSD treatment in both sexes.

On day 65, after assessing rats using the elevated plus-maze (EPM) test, corticosterone, BDNF, and apoptotic markers were tested. p < 0.05 was considered as significant level. The results showed that ovariectomy worsened the effect of SPS on hippocampal BDNF and led to greater increase in serum corticosterone and hippocampal caspase 3 and BAX in SPS rats. Also, ovariectomy exacerbated anxiety-like behavior in SPS rats. Exercise improved the alterations of hippocampal BDNF, corticosterone, caspase 3, and BAX in SPS ovariectomized rats. However, exercise had no statistically significant effect on anxiety-like behavior in this group. According to the results, exercise is effective to attenuate SPS-induced impairments in molecular and cellular responses even when the condition becomes more complicated due to ovarian hormone deficiency. However, exercise alone cannot help to improve behavior impairments in PTSD combined with an ovarian hormone deficiency. Therefore, exercise could likely be considered as a complementary intervention to strengthen other treatments.

Fluoxetine (FLX) as a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor is considered as the first line of treatment for PTSD. Exercise can improve the symptoms of PTSD. The aim of this study was to determine the effects of exercise and FLX on testicular tissue and sex hormones in rats with PTSD. Materials and methods: In this experimental study, 80 adult male rats were divided into two groups: PTSD and healthy. Then, each group was divided into four subgroups: control, exercise, fluoxetine, and fluoxetine + exercise. PTSD was induced by single prolonged stress. Fourteen days after induction of PTSD, moderate forced treadmill exercise was performed for 4 weeks, 5 days/week. Fluoxetine was administered at 10 mg/kg/day dissolved in drinking water for 4 weeks. Four weeks after treatment, the fear extinction test, testicular structure, and testosterone and FSH levels were evaluated. Results: PTSD decreased testosterone level and fear extinction but increased follicle-stimulating hormone. Fluoxetine and exercise had protective effect on testicular damage and also increased testosterone level and extinction index but decreased FSH level. Findings showed that co-administration of exercise and fluoxetine was more effective on these parameters. Combination of exercise and fluoxetine significantly increased fear extinction in PTSD rats (P<0.05). Conclusion: Exercise and fluoxetine had a protective effect on testicular tissue structure and hormonal disorders caused by PTSD and also decreased fear caused by stress, which is one of the symptoms of this disease. <c2><a9> 2022, Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences.

Materials and methods: We used single prolonged stress (SPS) model as an animal model for PTSD. Male and female rats were divided into two groups: Sham and SPS. After Two weeks, interventions, including treadmill exercise (4 weeks, 5 days per week), fluoxetine (10 mg/kg/day), and combined treatment were performed. Then, anxiety and memory test and tunnel assessments were done. Results: SPS rats exhibited increased anxiety levels in light/dark box and enhanced hippocampal apoptotic cells. Male SPS rats showed impaired spatial memory in object-location memory task. Treadmill exercise, fluoxetine, and combined treatment reduced anxiety levels, improved spatial memory, and decreased positive tunnel cells in the hippocampus. Furthermore, combined treatment with fluoxetine and treadmill exercise was found to be more effective than fluoxetine alone. Female rats had more resilience than male rats. Conclusion: Combined intervention with moderate exercise and fluoxetine is more useful in treatment of behavioral and cellular injuries in PTSD patients. <c2><a9> 2021, Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences.

Results: SPS male rats showed reduced spatial memory and hippocampal BDNF. Female rats showed more resistance to SPS than male rats. This may be due to the effects of gonadal hormones. The intervention alleviated the SPS-induced alterations in hippocampal-dependent spatial memory and BDNF serum levels in both male and female rats (P<0.05). Conclusion: Combined exercise and fluoxetine administration are more effective in alleviating behavioral and molecular deficits in PTSD patients. <c2><a9> 2019, Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences.

However, the efficacy of drug and psychotherapy methods, even in combination is still low. Therefore, complementary treatments are being researched. The relative improvement of PTSD has been observed with the use of Serotonin Selective Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs). The effect of exercise has also been determined in improving physical and mental health. But the appropriate exercise intensity is still in question. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the effect of intense exercise, fluoxetine, and their combined treatment on behavioral, molecular, and cellular damages caused by a standard model of PTSD. Materials and methods: Single prolonged stress (SPS) was used as a model to induce PTSD. Exercise (1 hour, 15 m/min) was planned for five days per week and fluoxetine (10 mg/kg/day) dissolved in drinking water was administered for four weeks. After performing the anxiety test, the animals were killed under deep anesthesia and blood samples were collected to measure IGF-1 serum levels by ELISA method and prefrontal cortex was frozen to measure apoptotic factors by RT-PCR method. Results: SPS rats showed increased anxiety levels and decreased serum IGF-1 levels. Increased Bax and Caspase-3 mRNA expression, and decreased Bcl2 mRNA expression were found in the prefrontal cortex. Exercise, fluoxetine, and their combined intervention increased IGF-1, decreased the expression of pro-apoptotic factors, and increased the expression of anti-apoptotic factors. The results showed that the combined intervention of exercise and fluoxetine could reduce the anxiety caused by SPS.

However, the efficacy of drug and psychotherapy methods, even in combination is still low. Therefore, complementary treatments are being researched. The relative improvement of PTSD has been observed with the use of Serotonin Selective Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs). The effect of exercise has also been determined in improving physical and mental health. But the appropriate exercise intensity is still in question. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the effect of intense exercise, fluoxetine, and their combined treatment on behavioral, molecular, and cellular damages caused by a standard model of PTSD. Materials and methods: Single prolonged stress (SPS) was used as a model to induce PTSD. Exercise (1 hour, 15 m/min) was planned for five days per week and fluoxetine (10 mg/kg/day) dissolved in drinking water was administered for four weeks. After performing the anxiety test, the animals were killed under deep anesthesia and blood samples were collected to measure IGF-1 serum levels by ELISA method and prefrontal cortex was frozen to measure apoptotic factors by RT-PCR method. Results: SPS rats showed increased anxiety levels and decreased serum IGF-1 levels. Increased Bax and Caspase-3 mRNA expression, and decreased Bcl2 mRNA expression were found in the prefrontal cortex. Exercise, fluoxetine, and their combined intervention increased IGF-1, decreased the expression of pro-apoptotic factors, and increased the expression of anti-apoptotic factors.

Conclusion: Considering that fluoxetine was more effective in comparison with high-intensity exercise, it is clear that in the groups that were affected by both interventions", fluoxetine played a more significant role.,NA,na,na,2023,na,na,na,na,na,2023-12-06T09:50:28Z,acca248b-ed3b-42dd-9160-1f5306d25ff2,personal correspondence,FALSE,a069f7a4-198d-40b2-8f8b-b126818a231a,Malcolm Macleod,Animal,Complete randomisation,Unclear,Unclear,Unclear,Unclear,Unclear,Unclear,Unclear,Unclear,Unclear,Unclear,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,Yes,No,Yes,Yes,No,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,Yes,NA (ethical approval declared),No,Yes,No,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,NA,Behavioural + pharmacological,Single prolonged stress (e.g. combination of restraint and forced swim stress),polyethylene restrainer, forced swim, diethy ether,diethyl ether,999,NA,999,Forced  (stressful stimulus/restraint),treadmill,28,Days,Multiple sessions,20,1,Days,15,,(speed) meters per minute (m/min),60,Minutes,,Non-NT gene or protein expression/level (e.g. BDNF in plasma or western blot),28,Days,Measured from figures,Endpoint measurement,Continuous,TRUE,28,Female,WT,Rat,Wistar (rat),Exact number,7,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,At recruitment to study,NA,NA,200,250,Grams (g),Yes,2023-12-06T22:15:43Z,98782f13-eac1-4e2f-8ee4-de1f09c3aca9,Experiment 1,7c085ac2-7fec-418b-b7b3-689dcda6cf85,SPS - Ex - Fl,7,False,69bbf159-2162-40d5-b357-703dc3d90425,SPS,False,True,NA,f87e4bf3-9236-4130-95cc-7ab96e57a053,d899471b-3f6f-4199-a386-c75150dc144a,NA,exercise,fluoxetine,NA,c2263336-9120-4175-bc21-a386c8f3f7a7,Caspase expression,TRUE,0,0.27,Mean,ratio,0.04,SEM,Intervention,cotreatment,Intervention and cotreatment,cca52be3-392a-4c70-aa3c-7a1ce287a4f0.98782f13-eac1-4e2f-8ee4-de1f09c3aca9.c2263336-9120-4175-bc21-a386c8f3f7a7.0,SPS - Sham Ex - Fl,7,0.34,0.07,SPS - Ex - Fl,7,0.27,0.04,NA,NA,NA,NA,Other,fluoxetine

However, the efficacy of drug and psychotherapy methods, even in combination is still low. Therefore, complementary treatments are being researched. The relative improvement of PTSD has been observed with the use of Serotonin Selective Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs). The effect of exercise has also been determined in improving physical and mental health. But the appropriate exercise intensity is still in question. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the effect of intense exercise, fluoxetine, and their combined treatment on behavioral, molecular, and cellular damages caused by a standard model of PTSD. Materials and methods: Single prolonged stress (SPS) was used as a model to induce PTSD. Exercise (1 hour, 15 m/min) was planned for five days per week and fluoxetine (10 mg/kg/day) dissolved in drinking water was administered for four weeks. After performing the anxiety test, the animals were killed under deep anesthesia and blood samples were collected to measure IGF-1 serum levels by ELISA method and prefrontal cortex was frozen to measure apoptotic factors by RT-PCR method. Results: SPS rats showed increased anxiety levels and decreased serum IGF-1 levels. Increased Bax and Caspase-3 mRNA expression, and decreased Bcl2 mRNA expression were found in the prefrontal cortex. Exercise, fluoxetine, and their combined intervention increased IGF-1, decreased the expression of pro-apoptotic factors, and increased the expression of anti-apoptotic factors. The results showed that the combined intervention of exercise and fluoxetine could reduce the anxiety caused by SPS.
